# Flickr Rainbow Wall + Filters

This is a simple app that allows users to search for a term in Flickr and sorts them by color, from low frequencies (Red), to high frequencies (Violet). **Bonus!** The app also allows to apply a set of (boring) filters to all images contained on the array.

To deploy this app:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:andfoy/nodeExpressFlickr.git flickr_rainbow
cd flickr_rainbow
npm install
npm run build
node server
```
And open [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)
